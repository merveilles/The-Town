## Community Funding Index

This document is intended to be converted to HTML and inserted to the custom extended information page:

Which will make it available on the instance about page: https://merveilles.town/about/more

This section contains a voluntary index, maintained by the community, of ways to financially support individual members of the Town. 
If you are looking for how to help bolster the instance's recurring costs, see [the Finances](https://merveilles.town/about/more#finances).

<!-- Let's use inverse alphabetical sort, to surface people who have always ended up at the bottom :^) 
Also, let's try to use one page per person? Personal index pages, listing multiple ways of supporting one, are very welcome.
