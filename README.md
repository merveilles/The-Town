### Introduction

Upon joining the instance, we recommend that you first add an avatar to your profile, and write a post that describes who you are, include the `#introduction` tag in your post. You should also consider pinning this to your profile.

### Merveilles is Invite Only

We want to keep the instance small. The aim of the Town is to facilitate a discussion on the various projects created by members of the Merveilles community. So, that is why we are keeping things invite-only for the time being. This is intentional to reduce the overhead on the moderation team and to focus on our existing members more. You may only receive an invite if someone already on the instance recommends you to the moderation team for review. Merveilles members should reach out to [Somnius](https://merveilles.town/@somnius) or [Devine](https://merveilles.town/@neauoire) to invite new people.

### Local Feed

The local feed is used by members of the instance to share posts that invite conversations at a slower pace than the home timeline. We try to keep it free of threads, shitposts, testing posts, and public replies. We invite anyone wanting to make a public thread, to first make a public post, and unlisted subsequent posts. That way, someone may click on the visible first post, to read more into the discussion. If you are to share pictures in the local feed, we suggest that you add an image description.

## Updates & Improvements

We have a [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/kGZUUev9/the-town). This is used to show what improvements or adjustments are being made to the instance. Please take a look, and if you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out to the admins.

### Finances

This instance is funded by donations from Merveilles members, and a financial report is posted by [Somnius](https://merveilles.town/@somnius) each month that shows how much money is spent and received. If you would like to donate to keep the instance running, please feel free to do so on these platforms below. Any extra income over server expenses are used to fund Merveilles projects.

### Animal Products

### Brands & Products

While it is encouraged on the instance to share personal projects, it is discouraged to use the platform as a "brand", or to use your account solely to do repeated advertisement of products. You're welcome to add fundraising links to your profile description, and to share them on the local timeline from time to time.
