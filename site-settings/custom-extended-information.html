<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Upon joining the instance, we recommend that you first add an avatar to your profile, and write a post that describes
  who you are, include the <code>#introduction</code> tag in your post. You should also consider pinning this to your
  profile.</p>
<h3 id="merveilles-is-invite-only">Merveilles is Invite Only</h3>
<p>We want to keep the instance small. The aim of the Town is to facilitate a discussion on the various projects created
  by members of the Merveilles community. So, that is why we are keeping things invite-only for the time being. This is
  intentional to reduce the overhead on the moderation team and to focus on our existing members more. You may only
  receive an invite if someone already on the instance recommends you to the moderation team for review. Merveilles
  members should reach out to <a href="https://merveilles.town/@somnius">Somnius</a> or <a
    href="https://merveilles.town/@neauoire">Devine</a> to invite new people.</p>
<h2 id="updates-improvements">Updates &amp; Improvements</h2>
<p>We have a <a href="https://trello.com/b/kGZUUev9/the-town">Trello Board</a>. This is used to show what improvements
  or adjustments are being made to the instance. Please take a look, and if you have any suggestions, feel free to reach
  out to the admins.</p>
<h3 id="finances">Finances</h3>
<p>This instance is funded by donations from Merveilles members, and a financial report is posted by <a
    href="https://merveilles.town/@somnius">Somnius</a> each month that shows how much money is spent and received. If
  you would like to donate to keep the instance running, please feel free to do so on these platforms below. Any extra
  income over server expenses are used to fund Merveilles projects.</p>
